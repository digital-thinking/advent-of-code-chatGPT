    "To solve this problem, we can split the input string into a list of assignment pairs and iterate through this list. For each pair, we will split each assignment into its start and end section IDs and store these in a tuple. Then, we will check if one assignment fully contains the other by comparing the start and end IDs of the two assignments. If one assignment fully contains the other, we will increment a counter num_overlaps and continue to the next pair.\n",
