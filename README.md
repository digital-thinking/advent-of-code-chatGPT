Using ChatGPT to solve Advent of code challenges

This repository shows how ChatGPT performs on puzzle-like tasks from Advent of Code
I am usually trying to copy/paste the description from the website into the prompt. I usually add that it should create a Python code. The explanation and the code is than put into the jupyter notebook.
I document how many tries I needed to get working code or when I stopped trying in the headline.

I will update my conclusion after the challenge, but by now I am very impressed and I hope that shows that we can get rid of leetcode in interviews.
